### About
I'm a software engineer living and working in Austin, Texas. I graduated from [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu) with a degree in Computer Engineering and have held a variety of roles at companies such as Vignette (now [OpenText](http://www.opentext.com)), [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com), and [Nationwide Marketing Group](https://www.nationwidegroup.org). I'm currently working at [Artesion](https://www.artesion.com) as a Principal Engineer on [edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing) solutions.

I've had an interest in technology as far back as I can remember and still love solving problems and making lives easier through software. Outside of work, I keep busy with my wife and our two daughters.
